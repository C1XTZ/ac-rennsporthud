## License

This repository is under the [GNU GPL v3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) license. What does this mean?

### What you can do:

- Modify the code
- Use the code privately and commercially
- Distribute the code (including in other projects)

### What you are required to do:

- Make the source code public (which means you cannot obfuscate the code in any way)
- Maintain the same license for any forks/modifications you do
- State what you have changed (this includes a simple "I changed the images and numbers")

### What you don't get:

- Liability
- Warranty

This may seem like a lot, but the general gist is: if you're going to use it, make sure people know where it's from, or if you're going to modify it, the modifications are public. The easiest way to do this is to create a [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) of the repo/file you want to use/modify.

Any questions or suggestions feel free to message me here, on Discord or on Twitter.
